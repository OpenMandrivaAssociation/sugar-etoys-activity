%description
Squeak Etoys was inspired by LOGO, PARC-Smalltalk, Hypercard, starLOGO
and AgentSheets. It is a media-rich authoring environment with a simple,
powerful scripted object model for many kinds of objects created by end-users
that runs on many platforms, and it is free and open source. It includes 2D and
3D graphics, images, text, particles, presentations, web-pages, videos, sound
and MIDI, etc. It includes the ability to share desktops with other Etoy users
in real-time, so many forms of immersive mentoring and play can be done over
the Internet.
